Like MELPA's list, but for all packages.

Browser interface for searching for Emacs packages.

** Data sources

- MELPA :: MELPA has JSON for its package list (used by its frontend) so this is simple.
- Other ELPAs :: the ELPA =archive-contents= format isâ€¦ Emacs Lisp S-expressions. Reasonable given its main use. But this means we have to run Emacs to process it at some point. It's far better to do this at build time, of course.
- emacsmirror :: Currently I'm reading the list of builtin packages from emacsmirror.

** Set up

#+begin_src sh
make dev
#+end_src

Which runs =bun install=, goes into =web/=, and runs the Astro dev server.
